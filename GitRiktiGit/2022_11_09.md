- # [[git]] & [[GitHub]] Lecture

	- ## git
		- ### We have:
			- created repositories in GitHub
			- cloned repository -> locally
			- files are tracked by git
			- synced our local files with GitHub using:
				- (through VS Code commit button)
				- git add <file>
				- git commit -m "message"
				- git push
			- in one branch called master in git, or main in github
		- ### Commit History
			- when working with one branch we have a linear commit history
			- commit history can be seen as kind of a "checkpoint" system that can be jumped back to in different ways
		- ### Repository / Project Folder
			- is a container with files tracked by git
			- has .git folder inside, created either when using git init or when cloning a remote repository
			- files are tracked in folder .git is placed in, and all its subfolders
		- ### Stages:
			- Modified
				- files changed (not commited)
				- git add file ("git add ." using dot takes all modified files) -> add files to staging area
				- by moving modified files to staging area one by one you can get individual commit messages
			- Staging
				- security and organisation layer
				- a chance to look at changes before committing, and option to undo staging
				- git commit -> all files in staging area to committed area
			- Committed
				- files are synced
		- ### Time Travel
			- use git log to see which commits exist in repository
			- shows commit messages and an id corresponding to the commits
			- commands in order from safe to dangerous:
				- 1 git checkout commit
					- checks commit, does not alter history
					- to see how the repository looked in an earlier point in time
				- 2 git revert commit
					- undo specific commit
				- 3 git reset commit
					- goes back to specific commit
					- deletes everything from that point forward (it is possible to get back unless using --hard)
		- ### Branches
			- different people can make branches of a repository
			- do not work on main branch, work on feature branches
			- commands:
				- git checkout name - switch to branch
				- git branch name - create new branch
				- git branch -d name - delete branch
				- git branch - see branches
		- ### Merging & Conflicts
			- before merging, pull from target branch and resolve eventual conflicts in your branch
			- then merge commit into target branch
		- ### Pull Requests
			- note: this is a request to allow for main to pull in your branch
			- before merging, create pull request in github
			- this allows for collaborators to review changes and discuss
		- ### Commands, exploration using git bash
			- ***ls*** - list
			- ***ls -al, ls -al, ls -a*** - difference?
			- ***mkdir foldername*** - create folder
			- ***cd foldername*** - change directory
			- ***explorer .*** - open directory in file explorer
			- ***touch file***
			- ***git status*** - shows modified
			- ***git add file*** -> move to staging area
			- ***git status*** -> no commits yet, use:
			- ***git rm --cached file*** - to unstage
			- ***git commit -m "message"***
			- (common mistake to use ***git commit*** (without -m) -> use ***:wq*** to quit out of the editor)
			- ***git log*** - history
			- ***git log*** - commit history
			- ***git log --oneline*** - cleaner commit history
			- ***git checkout ID*** - shows repo at commit point, can detach head
			- ***git checkout ID .*** - to avoid detaching head when using checkout
			- ***git checkout master/main*** - go back to main
			- ***git reset ID*** - go back to point, reverts version history, but code is intact and can be committed again
			- ***git reset ID --hard*** - reverts code as well
